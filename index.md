### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 Part 2 Date Difference
	At the beginning of this lab, I thought that I was going to do simple calculations, but I later learned that I was very wrong. This lab had me learn and implement the Fliegel & Van Flandern equation into a function, which allowed me to calculate the difference between 2 dates. This really expanded my understanding of the calculation that needs to be done in a program.

* Lab 7 Part 2 - Blackjack
	Blackjack was a game I’ve heard from many people around me but I’ve never been familiar with the game. In this Lab, I learned to write a few functions and implemented loops that run through the process of playing Blackjack including the varying nature of Aces in the hand.

* Lab 9 Part 2 Secret Number Game
	The idea of this lab was simple where the program ask for a secret number, and if the next player can guess the number they win or lose if guessed incorrectly. So upon creating the source codes for this lab, I utilized input & output streams that interact with both players, with file input & file output streams that allow for the game to be played from different clients/devices.
